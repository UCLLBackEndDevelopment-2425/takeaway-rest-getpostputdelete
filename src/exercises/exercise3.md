# Exercise 3

Try the GET end-point http://localhost:8080/pizza/{price} in Postman.
* This end-point should return only the pizza(s) with the given price.
* This end-point uses a path variable. Which part of the URL is the path variable?

Implement the same functionality using a request parameter for this the same functionality.
* What is the difference between both options?

If you look at your code now, probably you have two blocks of code which are identically the same, refactor this block by moving it to a separate method.
